# Text Spammer

A simple but advanced **text spamming tool** that allows users to send repeated messages automatically to any text input field (such as a chat window). The program listens for **Enter** to start spamming and **Escape** to stop it.

## Features
- **Global Keyboard Hook**: Listens for key presses to start/stop spamming.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows the user to enter a message, repetition count, and delay.
- **Multithreaded Execution**: Runs the spamming process in a separate thread.
- **Lightweight & Console-Based**: Simple and efficient with minimal system overhead.

## How It Works
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the message to be spammed.
3. Enter the number of times the message should be sent.
4. Enter the delay (in milliseconds) between messages.
5. **Press Enter** to start spamming.
6. **Press Escape** to stop spamming.
7. Ensure the target application (e.g., a chat box) is in focus.

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting
### "Keyboard hook not working"
- Try **running the program as an administrator**.

### "Spam not appearing in some applications"

### "Multiple instances running"
- The program does not prevent multiple instances. Close any duplicate processes.
